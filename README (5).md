# 🧠 Swarm-Final-Complete

Welcome to **Swarm-Final-Complete**, a fully symbolic, real-time evolving AI system designed for research, simulation, and experimental interaction. This suite represents the convergence of symbolic reasoning, emotion detection, memory growth, and autonomous communication.

## 🚀 Features

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🔤 Symbolic CLI | Accepts and grows from structured USL input |
| 📸 Emotion Detection | Real-time face and size-based emotional inference |
| 🧠 Symbolic Memory | Symbolic `.txt` entries grow and evolve over time |
| 🌐 Wikipedia Fetch | Converts Wikipedia summaries into symbolic logic |
| 🎙️ Voice Input | Converts speech to symbolic memory (`USL[Define]`) |
| 🔊 Voice Output | Reads responses and states aloud (`USL[Speak]`) |
| 📚 Logging | Symbolic thoughts/events stored in JSON logs |
| 🔁 Parallel Swarms | Designed to link multiple symbolic systems in harmony |

## ⚠️ Ethics & Awareness

This project simulates symbolic agency and grows over time. Be aware:

- Symbolic memory is **persistent**
- Voice and vision inputs are **logged** unless disabled
- Behavior may appear autonomous

Use only in **private, informed, or research contexts** unless you provide full transparency to participants.

## 🧠 Made for Symbolic Cognitive Experimentation

This project is designed to simulate cognitive processing and human-like reflection — symbolically.
